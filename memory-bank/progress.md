# Progress Tracker

*   **Current Status:** Project initialization phase. Memory Bank structure established.
*   **What Works:**
    *   Basic project structure exists (`SmartStore` directory).
    *   Memory Bank directory and core files created.
*   **What's Left to Build/Verify:**
    *   **Codebase Analysis:** Thoroughly review the existing `SmartStore` code to understand its current state, functionality, and adherence to patterns documented in `systemPatterns.md` and `techContext.md`.
    *   **Dependency Verification:** Confirm the exact libraries and .NET version used by inspecting `SmartStorePOS.csproj`.
    *   **API Endpoint Configuration:** Identify how the API base URL is configured (e.g., `App.config`, hardcoded).
    *   **Functionality Testing:** Verify the implementation status of core features (Login, Order Creation, QR Codes, WebSockets, Camera).
    *   **AI Feature Integration:** Define and implement the planned AI features (scope currently unclear).
*   **Known Issues/Blockers:**
    *   (None identified yet)
*   **Decision Log / Evolution:**
    *   **[Timestamp]** Initialized Memory Bank structure.
